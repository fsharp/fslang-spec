## Overview

This is an initiative to create a more complete and community-maintainable F# spec.

This will be no small task, but we believe it is worthwhile and we count on community contributions.

We foresee three phases:

1. Convert the [latest official spec](https://fsharp.org/specs/language-spec/4.1/FSharpSpec-4.1-latest.pdf) to markdown and create the structure and tools to make it community-maintainable. This is done.
2. Add the post-4.1 features as documented in the [RFCs](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design/) to the spec. Our goal: a complete F# 10 spec.
3. Make spec update part of new feature development so that an up-to-date spec can be released with every new major compiler release.
