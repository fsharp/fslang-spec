# Special Attributes and Types

This chapter describes attributes and types that have special significance to the F# compiler.

## Custom Attributes not Recognized by F#

The following custom attributes are defined in some CLI implementations and may appear to be
relevant to F#. However, they either do not affect the behavior of the F# compiler, or result in an
error when used in in F# code.

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |

## Exceptions Thrown by F# Language Primitives

Certain F# language and primitive library operations throw the following exceptions.

| --- | --- |
| System.ArithmeticException | An arithmetic operation failed. This is the base class for exceptions such as System.DivideByZeroException and System.OverflowException. |
