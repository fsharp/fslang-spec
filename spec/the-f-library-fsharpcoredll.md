# The F# Library FSharp.Core.dll

All compilations reference the following two base libraries:

- The CLI base library `mscorlib.dll`.
- The F# base library `FSharp.Core.dll`.

The API documentation of these libraries can be found at [https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs) and [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/runtime-libraries-overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/runtime-libraries-overview), resp.


The following namespaces are automatically opened for all F# code:

```fsharp
open FSharp
open FSharp.Core
open FSharp.Core.LanguagePrimitives
open FSharp.Core.Operators
open FSharp.Text
open FSharp.Collections
open FSharp.Core.ExtraTopLevelOperators
```
A compilation may open additional namespaces may be opened if the referenced F# DLLs contain
`AutoOpenAttribute` declarations.


## Basic Types (FSharp.Core)

This section provides details about the basic types that are defined in `FSharp.Core`.

### Basic Type Abbreviations

| Type Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `obj` | `System.Object` |
| `exn` | `System.Exception` |
| `nativeint` | `System.IntPtr` |
| `unativeint` | `System.UIntPtr` |
| `string` | `System.String` |
| `float32`, `single` | `System.Single` |
| `float`, `double` | `System.Double` |
| `sbyte`, `int8` | `System.SByte` |
| `byte`, `uint8` | `System.Byte` |
| `int16` | `System.Int16` |
| `uint16` | `System.UInt16` |
| `int32`, `int` | `System.Int32` |
| `uint32` | `System.UInt32` |
| `int64` | `System.Int64` |
| `uint64` | `System.UInt64` |
| `char` | `System.Char` |
| `bool` | `System.Boolean` |
| `decimal` | `System.Decimal` |

### Basic Types that Accept Unit of Measure Annotations

| Type Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sbyte<_>` | Underlying representation `System.SByte`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `int16<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Int16`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `int32<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Int32`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `int64<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Int64`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `float32<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Single`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `float<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Double`, but accepts a unit of measure. |
| `decimal<_>` | Underlying representation `System.Decimal`, but accepts a unit of measure. |

### The nativeptr<_> Type

When the `nativeptr<type>` is used in method argument or return position, it is represented in
compiled CIL code as either:

- A CLI pointer type `type*`, if `type` does not contain any generic type parameters.
- T CLI type `System.IntPtr` otherwise.

> Note : CLI pointer types are rarely used. In CLI metadata, pointer types sometimes
appear in CLI metadata unsafe object constructors for the CLI type `System.String`.
<br>
You can convert between `System.UIntPtr` and `nativeptr<'T>` by using the inlined
unverifiable functions in `FSharp.NativeInterop.NativePtr`.
<br>
`nativeptr<_>` compiles in different ways because CLI restricts where pointer types can
appear.

## Basic Operators and Functions (FSharp.Core.Operators)

### Basic Arithmetic Operators

## Native Pointer Operations

The [FSharp.Core.NativeInterop namespace](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-nativeinterop.html) contains functionality for interoperating with native code.

Use of these functions is unsafe, and incorrect use may generate invalid IL code.

| Operator or Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NativePtr.ofNativeInt` | Returns a typed native pointer for a machine address. |
| `NativePtr.toNativeInt` | Returns a machine address for a typed native pointer. |
| `NativePtr.add` | Computes an indexed offset from the input pointer. |
| `NativePtr.read` | Reads the memory that the input pointer references. |
| `NativePtr.write` | Writes to the memory that the input pointer references. |
| `NativePtr.get` | Reads the memory at an indexed offset from the input pointer. |
| `NativePtr.set` | Writes the memory at an indexed offset from the input pointer. |
| `NativePtr.stackalloc` | Allocates a region of memory on the stack. |

### Stack Allocation

The `NativePtr.stackalloc` function works as follows. Given

```fsharp
stackalloc<ty> n
```
the unmanaged type `ty` specifies the type of the items that will be stored in the newly allocated
location, and `n` indicates the number of these items. Taken together, these establish the required
allocation size.

The `stackalloc` function allocates `n * sizeof<ty>` bytes from the call stack and returns a pointer of
type `nativeptr<ty>` to the newly allocated block. The content of the newly allocated memory is
undefined. If `n` is a negative value, the behavior of the function is undefined. If `n` is zero, no allocation
is made, and the returned pointer is implementation-defined. If insufficient memory is available to
allocate a block of the requested size, the `System.StackOverflowException` is thrown.

Use of this function is unsafe, and incorrect use might generate invalid IL code. For example, the
function should not be used in `with` or `finally` blocks in `try`/`with` or `try`/`finally` expressions. These
conditions are not checked by the F# compiler, because this primitive is rarely used from F# code.

There is no way to explicitly free memory that is allocated using stackalloc. All stack-allocated
memory blocks that are created during the execution of a function or member are automatically
discarded when that function or member returns. This behavior is similar to that of the `alloca`
function, an extension commonly found in C and C++ implementations.
