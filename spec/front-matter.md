# F# Language Specification

This documentation is work-in-progress, aiming at a F# 10 specification.
<br>It has been built based on the [F# 4.1 spec](https://fsharp.org/specs/language-spec/4.1/FSharpSpec-4.1-latest.pdf)
and does not yet incorporate all RFCs.

## Included RFCs

| RFC id | Topic |
| --- | --- |
| 4.0 speclet | class names as functions |
| FS-1004 | result type |
| FS-1005 | underscores in numerical fields |
| FS-1006 | struct tuples |
| FS-1031 | allow implementing the same generic interface for different types in the same enclosing type |
| FS-1091 | units of measure for more types |
